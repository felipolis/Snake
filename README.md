# Snake Game

## About

I've started studying front-end and recently I've created this classic Snake Game. Basically you control the snake and eat the apples on the ground. You can pass trough walls but if you bite your tail you lose.

## What have I used?

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript


## Try yourself
